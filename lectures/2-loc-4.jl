# pounds and is shipped at \$0.25 per ton-mile. @tbl-emca gives the
# number of customers $n$ grouped by three-digit ZIP code across the
# Carolinas. They have estimated that they will be able to lease each
# machine for \$100,000 per year; the lease cost includes the rental
# cost of housing it in a portion of an existing manufacturing facility.
# EMCA would like to know how many machines are needed to best serve
# their customers and where they should locate the machines, assuming
# that each machine can produce up to 2 million units of product per
# year.
